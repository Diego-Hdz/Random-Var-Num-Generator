# Random-Var-Num-Generator

This repo contains two java files which compute Random Numbers and Variables.

**RandNumGen.java :** Computes random numbers using a linear congruential random number generator. The user enters the i<sup>th</sup> numbers to be calulated and the formula values for the following equation:

![RandNumEq](https://github.com/Diego-Hdz/Random-Var-Num-Generator/blob/master/RandNum.png "Random Number Equation")

**RandVarGen.java :** Computes a random variable realization for a continuous random variable with exponential distribution given a random number and a lambda. Calcaulated using the following formula:

*NOTE: x<sub>i</sub> in this equation is **not** the same as the one in the random number generator.*
