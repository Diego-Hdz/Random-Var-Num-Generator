# Random-Var-Num-Generator

This repo contains two java files which compute Random Numbers and Variables.

**RandNumGen.java :** Computes random numbers using a linear congruential random number generator. The user enters the i<sup>th</sup> numbers to be calulated and the formula values for the following equation.

**RandVarGen.java :** Computes a random variable realization for a continuous random variable with exponential distribution given a random number and a lambda.
